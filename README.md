# Number-guessing-game
Guess The Number is a simple interactive desktop game developed in C++ using the Windows API (WinAPI). The application generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to guess the number through a graphical user interface.  The program provides real-time feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
